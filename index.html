    <h2>Bentley Mulsanne (2010)</h2>
    <i
      >The Bentley Mulsanne is an executive sedan designed as an alternative to
      the outdated Arnage. Serial production began in mid-2010. Named after one
      of the corners of the Sarte racing circuit at Le Mans. The Mulsanne is the
      first car in 80 years (since 1930) built on Bentley's own platform.</i

    <p>
      For the Bentley Mulsanne at the headquarters of the British concern, an
      original, rather than borrowed, as before, platform with a wheelbase of
      3266 mm was designed. The 6.75-litre (V-8) twin supercharged engine (peak
      power 512 hp, peak torque 1020 Nm) is based on the Bentley Arnage cylinder
      block. The gearbox is an eight-speed automatic from the German
      ZahnradFabrik. The maximum speed is just under 300 km/h, acceleration to
      100 km/h takes 5.3 seconds. The average fuel consumption per 100 km is
      16.9 liters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customers of the car will be able to choose from 114 body color options.
      The interior of the Bentley Mulsanne uses genuine leather (24 color
      options will be offered), precious woods and hand-polished steel. The
      executive car will go into series with a 40-gigabyte hard drive, a
      navigator, a 14-speaker audio system and many other modern solutions for a
      conservative British brand.

      In 2014, a modification of the Bentley Mulsanne Speed was introduced,
      featuring boosted up to 537 hp. With. engine, "directional" rims, etc.

      In 2016, a restyling was carried out, which gave Mulsan a new grille,
      bumpers, front and rear optics, and a multimedia system. In addition, an
      elongated version of the Bentley Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase appeared with
      separate luxury rear seats and a sunroof over the rear of the cabin.

      The final batch of 30 cars was made in the spring of 2020. The flagship of
      the company is now the new Flying Spur.
